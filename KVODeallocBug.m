This bug arises when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) in Objective-C.  It's subtle because it doesn't always manifest immediately and can be hard to debug. The issue happens when you add an observer to an object, but that object is deallocated before the observer is removed. This leads to a crash when the observed object's properties change after it's been deallocated.  The crash usually looks something like EXC_BAD_ACCESS or similar memory corruption errors.
