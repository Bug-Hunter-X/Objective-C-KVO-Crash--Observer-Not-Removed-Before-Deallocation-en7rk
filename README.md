This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO).  The bug occurs when an observer is not removed before the observed object is deallocated. This leads to a crash due to accessing deallocated memory. The solution shows how to correctly manage observers using the removeObserver method in the dealloc method or by using blocks for observation.
